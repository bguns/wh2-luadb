First, make sure you are subscribed to the companion mod for this tool, found at: <WIP - should be released soon>

1. Place both executables to the same directory as Kaedrin's Mod Manager (i.e. the directory that contains Warhammer2MM.exe)

2. (Optional) Create a shortcut to wh2-luadb-kmm-launcher.exe (right click -> Create Shortcut) and place it somewhere convenient.

3. Launch Kaedrin's Mod Manager by executing wh2-luadb-kmm-launcher.exe (or the shortcut you created in step 2).

5. It's possible that Windows warns you about executing an untrusted executable. This is normal. Click on "More information" and then "Run anyway". You should only need to do this the first time you run the launcher.

6. If your Total War: Warhammer 2 installation directory is under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\...(or another "protected" directory), it might be necessary to run wh2-luadb-kmm-launcher.exe as Administrator. To do so, create a shortcut (as in step 2, if you have not already done so), then right click that shortcut, go to Properties, then Advanced, and tick the "Run as Administrator" box.

7. Don't forget to activate the LuaDB mod in Kaedrin's Mod Manager before starting the game (WIP - this mod does not exist yet).
